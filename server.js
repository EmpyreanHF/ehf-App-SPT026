// MARKETPLACE ESCROW PAYOUT RULE (explicit — do not "helpfully" convert):
// a seller is paid in the EXACT SAME currency the buyer paid in. If the
// buyer paid fiat (NGN/USD/etc, via Flutterwave), the seller is credited
// that same fiat amount — never converted to EMPY. EMPY is only ever
// credited when the order's own currency IS 'EMPY' (i.e. the buyer paid
// with their EMPY balance for that listing), in which case it's a 1:1
// credit, not a rate conversion. See marketplace_orders' `currency`
// field, set at order-creation time directly from the listing's own
// priced currency — that already tells us what the buyer actually paid
// in; no separate "payment method" field is needed.
//
// Fiat credits are tracked in `users/{sellerId}.fiatBalance.<CURRENCY>` —
// a currency-keyed map, kept entirely separate from `empyBalance` so a
// naira sale can never inflate a seller's EMPY balance. NOTE: as of this
// writing there is no withdrawal UI/route wired to fiatBalance yet (the
// existing withdrawal_requests flow — app-patch-v48.js — is EMPY-only).
// Flagging this so it isn't a silent gap: sellers will accumulate a
// correct fiatBalance from marketplace sales, but cashing that out to a
// bank account needs its own withdrawal path, not built here.

// The logo file itself is a static asset — public/logo.png, alongside the

// pointed at it later.
// Two distinct assets, two distinct jobs:
//  - _logoUrl(): small square icon (icon-192.png) used as the <link rel="icon">
//    favicon — this is what WhatsApp/Messenger/Facebook render as the tiny
//    round logo NEXT TO the domain/link text at the bottom of the card
//    (see the reference screenshot: the small "f" badge beside facebook.com).
//  - _fallbackCardUrl(): the big 1200x630 branded card image, used as the
//    og:image ONLY when a post has no media of its own. Previously this
//    fallback was the same small circular logo.png stretched to fill the
//    whole image slot, which is why it looked oversized/plain instead of
//    a proper card — public/og-fallback.jpg is a purpose-built 1200x630
//    graphic (gradient background + centered emblem + wordmark) sized to
//    the exact aspect ratio WhatsApp/Facebook/Twitter expect.

// completely uncompressed. Express does not compress responses on its own;
// without this, `compression` was never even a dependency. Text compresses
// to roughly 20-30% of its original size with gzip, so this alone should
// cut total page-load bytes by 3-5x for every visitor — the single highest-
// leverage fix for the "site won't load" complaints, and it doesn't touch

// ── NEURAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH PROXY (ElevenLabs) ──────────────────────────────
// FEATURE: replaces the robotic OS-installed voice the "🔊 Hear this
// section" voice assistants (Donor Hub / Sponsor a Cause, and the Grant
// Transparency Portal — see index.html's §48/§49 blocks) used to rely on
// exclusively (window.speechSynthesis, whose actual voice quality is
// whatever happens to be installed on the visitor's OS — often noticeably
// robotic). This route generates real, human-sounding narration via
// ElevenLabs' Multilingual v2 model server-side, so the API key never
// reaches the browser (same "secret stays server-side, client only ever
// gets the derived result" pattern already used for Flutterwave's secret
// key and SendGrid's API key elsewhere in this file).
//
// The client falls back to speechSynthesis automatically if this route
// ever fails for any reason (key not configured, ElevenLabs outage, rate
// limit, network error) — see index.html's own try/catch around its
// fetch('/api/tts') call. Nothing else changes if ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is
// left unset: this route just answers 501 and the existing browser-voice
// behavior continues exactly as it did before this feature shipped.
//
// COST CONTROL: the handful of narration texts this feature actually
// serves (one per language, per section — a fixed, small set) are cached
// in memory by a hash of (lang + text), so the very first play of each
// language/section combo is the only one that ever calls the paid

// ── SERVER-SIDE NOTIFY LISTENERS (no client required) ────────────────────
// FIX (feature: "notifications should still go out even if nobody has the
// app open anywhere"): app-push-setup.js's old empyreanPostNotifyTrigger()
// was a Firestore listener that only ran INSIDE A BROWSER TAB — if nobody
// had the app open when a post/SOS/crisis doc was created, nothing fired
// until someone reconnected. This does the same job from inside THIS
// process instead. server.js is a persistent Node process (not a browser
// tab) that already stays running 24/7 on Render's starter plan, already
// has the Firebase Admin SDK credentials loaded (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_
// JSON, used by /api/notify above), and Admin SDK Firestore listeners run
// with admin privileges — they're not subject to the Firestore security
// rules a browser client would be. So the listener attaches once at boot
// and keeps running for the life of this server, independent of any
// client being connected. No Firebase Blaze plan needed — this isn't a
// Cloud Function, just another listener living in the same server process
// that already sends the pushes.
//
// IMPORTANT: this REPLACES app-push-setup.js's client-side trigger (Part
// 2, empyreanPostNotifyTrigger). That client-side code must stay removed/
// disabled once this is deployed — running both at once double-sends
// every notification. See the matching comment left in app-push-setup.js.
//
// Trade-off vs. a true Cloud Function: this depends on the Render dyno
// itself staying up. Render's starter plan doesn't sleep and restarts are
// rare, but a deploy or platform restart means a few seconds where the
// listener isn't attached — a Cloud Function has stronger uptime
// guarantees than any single server process, at the cost of needing the
// Blaze plan. Revisit if that gap ever matters for something urgent (e.g.
// SOS).

// NOTE: 'statuses' is deliberately NOT in this list -- unlike posts/sos/
// crisis/news/reels (one brand-new Firestore doc per post), a status is ONE
// doc per user (id "status-<uid>") whose `items` array just grows via a
// merge update (see app-status.js's writers). A generic "doc added" watcher
// would only ever fire for someone's very first-ever status and stay silent
// for every one after that, so statuses gets its own listener below
// (_watchStatuses) that diffs items.length instead of doc-added events.
// (Reels DO fit the generic pattern here -- app-fixes.js writes a fresh
// doc per upload via .doc(reelId).set(...); the later .update() calls for
// likes/retweets are 'modified' events, which _watchCollection below
// already ignores, so those don't cause spurious re-notifications.)

// ── SCHEDULED-STREAM REMINDERS (v58 follow-up) ────────────────────────────
// v58's own client-side code (now merged into app-patch-v42.js — see that
// file's own header for the merge/renumbering note) deliberately
// shipped reminders through the in-app bell only, flagging true FCM push as
// a follow-up once /api/notify's contract was known — it's known now (see
// /api/notify above), so this wires the real thing.
//
// Why POLLING on an interval, not onSnapshot like NOTIFY_COLLECTIONS above:
// every other listener in this file fires on a DISCRETE EVENT ("a doc was
// just added"). A reminder fires when a CLOCK reaches a point relative to
// a field already sitting quietly in an existing doc — nothing changes in
// Firestore at the moment a reminder becomes due, so there's no snapshot
// event to hook. Polling once a minute (same cadence the client's own
// _checkReminders already uses) is the correct tool here, not a
// workaround.
//
// DEDUPE: unlike the client's own localStorage-based dedupe (which is
// necessarily per-device), this has to be per-DOCUMENT, because it's the
// one place that pushes to every recipient at once — a Firestore field
// (`reminder15Sent: true`) written back onto the scheduled_streams doc
// itself after sending is the natural place for that, and it means a
// server restart mid-window can never double-send: the field survives
// the restart even though the in-memory poll loop doesn't.
//
// TARGETING NOTE: this reads fcmToken off users/{uid} docs, populated by
// app-push-setup.js's _subscribeToken() passing uid to /api/fcm/subscribe
// (see that route's own comment above) whenever a real logged-in identity
// is available. A user who hasn't opened the app since this shipped, or
// who's only ever used it as a guest, simply has no fcmToken yet —
// admin.messaging().send() then has nothing to send to, and this no-ops
// for that one uid without throwing or blocking any other recipient/

// ── BIRTHDAY FEATURE — daily check + follower push ────────────────────────
// FEATURE: "on the user's birthday, send a push notification to all
// followers, with 'Wish Happy Birthday' and 'Send Gift' CTAs." The birthday
// FRAME itself (auto-applied to the profile picture) is computed purely
// client-side in app-profile.js by comparing today's month-day against the
// profile owner's own dobMonthDay — it needs no server involvement, since
// it's just "is today this specific date," recomputed fresh every time
// that profile renders. The one thing that genuinely needs a server-side
// job is this: reliably firing an OFFLINE push to every follower exactly
// once, which (like the scheduled-stream reminder above) has to run even
// when nobody has the app open anywhere.
//
// QUERY STRATEGY: dobMonthDay ('MM-DD', written once at signup — see
// app-auth.js's newUser object) lets this run a cheap equality query
// instead of pulling every user doc and parsing dates client-side; matters
// once this collection has more than a handful of users. Same reasoning
// FCM_BROADCAST_TOPIC's "topic" isn't used here as followedUserIds's own
// array-contains query below.
//
// FOLLOWER LOOKUP: there's no separate reverse-index "followers" table in
// this schema — but every user doc already stores its OWN followedUserIds
// array (see app-fixes.js's follow-button handler), so
// `where('followedUserIds', 'array-contains', birthdayUserId)` finds
// exactly the set of people who follow that user, with no schema change.
//
// FREQUENCY GUARD: lastBirthdayCelebratedYear (set on the user doc itself,
// survives a server restart) — same "mark handled before acting, so a
// mid-loop restart can't double-send" discipline
// _checkScheduledStreamReminders already uses above, just per-year instead

// ── /api/promotion/boost/confirm ── Verified Fiat-funded post boost ───────
// ADDED (2026-08-08): closes the exact gap app-fixes.js's own comment used
// to flag next to its post-boost card-payment FlutterwaveCheckout call —
// that path used to activate a promotion straight off Flutterwave's
// CLIENT-SIDE "successful" callback, with no server check a charge ever
// happened. Mirrors /api/promotion/confirm (business campaigns, just
// above) and /api/marketplace/order/confirm exactly: re-verifies the SAME
// tx_ref server-side via _verifyFlwTxRef() before writing anything.
//
// Separate route (and separate doc-id prefix, promo-boost-*) from
// /api/promotion/confirm rather than a shared one — the two write
// genuinely different document shapes into the same `promotions`
// collection (this one is postId/budgetNGN-keyed, matching
// app-live.js's registerPromotion() exactly; the business-campaign one is
// pageId/dailyBudget-keyed) and conflating them would risk one route's
// validation silently accepting the other shape's fields.
//
// budgetNGN is taken from Flutterwave's OWN confirmed charged amount —
// never from a client-submitted budget — so a manipulated request can't
// activate a bigger boost than was actually paid for. The doc shape below
// matches registerPromotion()'s own output field-for-field so the existing
// feed-ranking budgetScore formula (app-live.js's scorePost()) keeps
// working unchanged for fiat-funded boosts, same as it already does for
// wallet-funded ones.

// =============================================================================
// BACKGROUND: firebase-rules.js's isEmpyBalanceCreditOnlyUpdate/
// isLiveIncomeOnlyUpdate rules cap and direction-check CROSS-user credit
// writes, but the general owner rule further down (`allow write: if
// request.auth.uid == userId`) still let a signed-in client write ANY value
// into its OWN empyBalance directly — no cap, no direction check — because
// that rule doesn't scope which fields it covers. That's the actual "type
// one command in devtools, become a billionaire" hole, and every legitimate
// self-credit flow in the app (rank rewards, impact-mining task/action
// rewards, P2P listing-cancel refunds) was ALSO relying on that same
// unrestricted rule to write its own reward locally. Closing the hole and
// keeping those features working can't be done in firebase-rules.js alone
// — it means moving the actual crediting to server-side Admin SDK writes
// (which bypass client rules entirely and can enforce real business logic:
// reward tables, one-time-only checks, daily pool budgets) and then, only
// once that's done, tightening the client rule so it can no longer
// INCREASE its own empyBalance directly at all (see the matching
// firebase-rules.js diff shipped alongside this file — isSelfEmpyBalanceSafe).
// Decreases (spending EMPY on a gift, staking, listing something for sale,
// a wallet transfer send, etc.) are untouched — those are safe to leave
// client-writable and are not part of this migration.
//
// Auth/trust model: matches this codebase's existing convention for
// user-level (non-admin) money routes — see confirm-receipt/mark-dispatched
// above, which trust a client-supplied id checked against the field
// actually stored on the target document, rather than a bearer ID token.
// These five routes follow the same pattern; none of them trust a
// client-supplied REWARD AMOUNT, only a client-supplied identity, which is
// then checked against server-held state before anything is credited.
//
// CLIENT WIRING STATUS (2026-07-31, completion pass): all five routes above
// now have their client call sites migrated too — app-fixes.js's rank-
// reward and community-task claims, app-impactmining.js's _processReward
// (the 5 non-premium self-mining actions: SUCCESSFUL_ESCROW_SELLER/BUYER,
// SHARE_POST, RETWEET_POST, SEND_GIFT — see that file's own comment for why
// the 9 PREMIUM 60/40-split actions are NOT migrated here), and
// app-p2p-trading.js's _p2pCancelListing/_p2pReleaseEscrow. app-wallet.js's
// buy-empy-form (Flutterwave card purchase) was also found to be
// self-crediting directly from its own client-side payment callback — not
// one of the original five, but the same class of bug — and is now wired to
// this file's existing /api/wallet/confirm-purchase instead.
//
// STAKING — NOW BUILT (2026-07-31, follow-up to the completion pass above).
// app-wallet.js's stake-form/unstake-form/claim-reward-btn and
// simulateRewardAccrual()'s locked-staking release used to run on pure
// client-side numbers (manualStakedBalance/lockedStakedBalance/
// earnedRewards) with no Firestore-backed ledger at all — except the claim
// itself, which DID persist straight to empyBalance via a direct client
// write once tapped, from a client-computed "earned" figure a user could
// set to anything via devtools first. That's now closed: users/{userId}
// gains five new server-only fields (manualStakedBalance,
// lockedStakedBalance, lockedStakingEndTime, stakingEarnedRewards,
// stakingLastAccrualAt), computeStakingAccrual() below is the ONLY thing
// that ever advances stakingEarnedRewards or releases a matured lock, and
// four new endpoints (/api/staking/stake, /unstake, /claim-rewards, /sync)
// are the ONLY way any of those five fields change — see
// firebase-rules.js's touchesServerOnlyStakingFields, which blocks the
// client from writing any of them directly, same as empyBalance increases.
//
// STILL NOT covered by this: the 9 PREMIUM 60/40-split impact-mining
// actions (CREATE_POST, CREATE_REEL, PUBLISH_NEWS, LIVE_STREAM_INTERVAL,
// VERIFIED_CRISIS_REPORT, VERIFIED_SOS_REQUEST, SUCCESSFUL_REFERRAL,
// GUEST_JOINED_LIVE, HOST_INVITED_GUEST) still self-credit their 60%
// withdrawable portion via a direct client write, and their 40% locked
// portion was never persisted anywhere (see app-impactmining.js's own
// comment). Now that lockedStakedBalance/lockedStakingEndTime exist and
// are real, wiring those 9 actions to deposit their 40% here too — and
// crediting their 60% via claim-mining-reward instead of direct-write — is
// the natural next step, but is its own scoped change (needs
// claim-mining-reward to support a split credit), not bundled into this
// one. Because those 9 actions still self-credit directly,
// firebase-rules.js's general owner-write rule remains the CAPPED
// mitigation (isSelfEmpyBalanceNonIncreasing), not an outright ban — see
// that function's own comment.

// Mirrors app-state.js's own STAKING_APY_ESTIMATE / STAKING_LOCK_DURATION —
// the ONLY values used to compute a staking reward or a lock window
// server-side; the client never gets to submit its own accrual number or
// its own lock end time.
const STAKING_APY_ESTIMATE  = 0.157; // 15.7 %, matches the staking UI's own label
const STAKING_LOCK_DURATION = 6 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 6 months — for the day a locked deposit is created here too (see comment above)

// Recomputes a user's staking fields up to `now` from their currently
// stored doc — a pure function, no I/O, so every staking endpoint below
// calls it right after its own transaction's read and before applying
// whatever action-specific delta (stake/unstake/claim) it's handling.
// Two things happen here, independent of which endpoint called it:
//   1. Continuous APY accrual on manualStakedBalance, added to
//      stakingEarnedRewards (uncapped — it keeps growing until claimed,
//      same as the old client-side simulateRewardAccrual did).
//   2. Auto-release of lockedStakedBalance into empyBalance once
//      lockedStakingEndTime has passed (mirrors that same function's old
//      client-side auto-release — now happens here, the moment ANY
//      staking endpoint is next called, instead of on a client-side
//      per-second timer with no server involved at all).
// Nothing currently WRITES lockedStakedBalance for any user (the premium
// impact-mining reward's 40% lock split is still on the old
// client-authoritative direct-write path — see the SELF_MINING_ACTIONS
// comment above) — this function is already correct for the day that
// split gets migrated here too.

// table) — a client claiming "I liked this post, pay its owner" can't be
// trusted the same way a client claiming "I just created a post, pay ME"
// can (the latter is at least verifiable as "did this account's own write
// succeed"; the former requires trusting an unverifiable third-party
// claim). Instead of a client-called claim endpoint, these are credited
// automatically by startLikeCommentRewardListeners() below, which watches
// Firestore directly via the Admin SDK for a like/comment that ACTUALLY
// happened (a likedBy array gaining a new uid, confirmed by Firestore's
// own isToggleField/isOneTimeField-gated write rules — see
// firebase-rules.js — so this can't be forged by a client either) and
// credits the real owner the moment it's observed. See _creditReceiveReward
// and the listener functions further down this file.
// RETIRED (2026-08-15 — engagement-attribution fix): this used to pay the
// post/comment OWNER every time someone else liked/commented on their
// content. Two problems with that: (1) wrong side of the interaction — the

// in SELF_MINING_ACTIONS above); the "Receive a Like/Comment" forecast rate
// belongs to whoever performs the like/comment, not whoever receives it a
// second time — that's now ENGAGE_LIKE/ENGAGE_COMMENT in SELF_MINING_ACTIONS
// above. (2) receiving engagement is a creator-monetization concern, not an
// impact-mining one — app-monetization.js's computeEngagement() already
// reads a creator's total likes/commentCount/shareCount straight off their
// posts to gate their payout tier/eligibility, so a creator already gets
// real payout upside from receiving likes/comments through that system.
// Paying it again here, per-event, out of the mining pool was duplicate
// credit through the wrong channel. Left as an empty object (not deleted)
// per this codebase's own convention, and because _creditReceiveReward
// below still references it defensively — see startLikeCommentRewardListeners()

// here was duplicate credit through the mining pool). RECEIVE_MINING_ACTIONS

// deliberately-designed monetization payout ever wants this same
// observed-Firestore-diff pattern (it would need to credit a monetization

// _creditReceiveReward() is the shared crediting function both listener

// ── startLikeCommentRewardListeners() — RETIRED 2026-08-15, see below ──
// The notes in this comment block (SCOPE / COST NOTE / SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT)
// describe how this function used to behave when it was live. It no longer
// runs — see the RETIRED note right above _creditReceiveReward, and the
// early `return` at the top of the function itself. Kept for anyone
// designing a real, monetization-side replacement later: the same
// Watches-Firestore-directly / diff-likedBy / SCOPE / COST-NOTE /
// SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT shape would still apply to that, just crediting a
// monetization ledger instead of empyBalance.
//
// Watched Firestore directly (Admin SDK — bypasses firestore.rules, same
// as every other server-side listener in this file) for two things:
//   1. A post's `likedBy` array gaining a NEW uid  -> credited the post's
//      OWNER (data.userId) RECEIVE_LIKE, once ever per (post, liker) pair.
//   2. A NEW document appearing in any `comments` subcollection -> credited
//      the PARENT POST's owner RECEIVE_COMMENT, once ever per comment.
//      (If a comment document itself ever grows a `likedBy` array too,
//      the same diffing was applied there as a bonus — costs nothing if
//      that field never appears on comments in practice.)
//
// SCOPE (deliberate, first pass, back when this was live): only the
// top-level `posts` collection and its `comments` subcollection were
// covered. reels/news_posts/business_posts/etc. have their own likedBy
// fields too (per firebase-rules.js's shared isValidEngagementChange
// helper) but were never wired up here — moot now that receiving a
// like/comment doesn't pay EMPY at all, from any collection.
//
// COST NOTE: this attached a SEPARATE onSnapshot listener to the whole
// `posts` collection and to collectionGroup('comments'), on top of the
// existing top-5-only listener _watchCollection() already has on `posts`
// for push notifications. That meant every post document was read by two
// independent listeners instead of one — accepted at the time as the same
// "additive, don't touch the working thing" tradeoff this codebase makes
// elsewhere (see e.g. app-patch-v39's own header). Moot now that the
// listener never attaches.
//
// SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT: mirrored _watchCollection()'s own reasoning for
// exactly the same problem — a freshly (re)attached listener's first
// callback reports EVERY existing document as if it just changed. Without
// a guard, every restart would have re-diffed (and, without the
// receipt-doc idempotency check, re-credited) every like/comment that ever
// existed. The receipt-doc check in _creditReceiveReward was the real
// safety net; this flag only avoided needlessly attempting (and logging)
// thousands of already-credited transactions on every boot. Moot now.

// ── /api/marketplace/order/:id/confirm-receipt ── Buyer releases escrow ──
// Called when the buyer taps "Confirm Receipt" (client UI added in
// app-marketplace.js / app-marketplace-sellers.js's Orders pane). Flips
// status 'paid'/'dispatched' -> 'released' AND, atomically in the same
// Firestore transaction, credits the seller — in the SAME currency the
// buyer paid, per marketplace_orders' own `currency` field (set at
// order-creation time directly from the listing's priced currency, which
// is what Flutterwave actually charged the buyer in): fiat stays fiat
// (users/{sellerId}.fiatBalance.<CURRENCY>, a currency-keyed map, kept
// fully separate from empyBalance), and EMPY is only ever credited when
// the order's currency IS 'EMPY' — a 1:1 credit in that case, never a
// rate conversion. Also logs an entry into the existing `transactions`
// collection (same shape app-tokenpurchase.js's own purchase-callback
// already writes there), so this shows up in whatever transaction-
// history UI already reads that collection.
//
// Everything below happens inside ONE db.runTransaction() — the status
// flip, the balance credit, and the log write either all commit together
// or none do. This also closes a real correctness gap a naive get-then-
// update version of this route would have: two near-simultaneous
// confirm-receipt calls for the same order could both pass the "not yet
// released" check before either write landed, crediting the seller
// twice. A Firestore transaction can't do that — the second call's read
// is guaranteed to see the first call's write (or the transaction
// retries), so the status re-check happens under an actual lock.
//
// Fails safe rather than guessing: a zero/invalid order amount or a
// seller account that doesn't exist results in the order still being
// marked 'released' (the buyer's confirmation is honored either way —
// they shouldn't be stuck mid-flow over a crediting edge case) but
// WITHOUT a balance credit, flagged via `creditFailed`/
// `creditFailedReason` on the order doc for manual reconciliation, and
// reflected honestly in the seller's email (see email-templates.js's
// escrowSellerReleasedEmailTemplate).
//

// operate at (no server-side session/idToken check exists anywhere else

// AGORA CLOUD RECORDING — server-side, multi-participant composited
// replay (upgrade over v57's honestly-scoped host-device-only recording).
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Three Agora REST calls are involved, all authenticated with Basic auth
// built from a Customer ID/Secret pair (RESTful API credentials — a
// DIFFERENT credential pair from the App ID/App Certificate used for RTC
// tokens above, generated separately in Agora Console → RESTful API):
//   1. acquire   — reserve a resourceId for a (channel, uid) pair
//   2. start     — begin composited "mix mode" recording against that
//                  resourceId, writing straight to a third-party cloud
//                  storage bucket (Agora does not hold the files itself)
//   3. stop      — end recording, returns the fileList that landed in
//                  that bucket
// The recording joins the channel as its own dedicated Agora participant
// (a fixed bot uid, subscribing to every publisher — host, promoted
// guests, everyone) — this is precisely what closes v57's own documented
// gap ("doesn't composite in guest-broadcaster video/audio").
//
// STATE ACROSS acquire → start → stop: Agora requires the exact same
// resourceId + sid on the stop call that acquire/start returned. Kept in
// an in-memory Map (this server process stays up between those calls for
// any realistic stream length) AND mirrored to a `live_recordings/
// {channelName}` Firestore doc via the Admin SDK, purely as a crash-
// recovery backup — if this Render process restarts mid-recording, the
// in-memory Map is gone, but the Firestore doc still has enough (resourceId,
// sid, uid, channelName) for a manual/future recovery stop call, same
// "state that must survive a restart goes to Firestore, not memory alone"
// discipline the scheduled-stream reminder dedupe above already follows.

//         {uid} (see app-feed.js), which works because a uid can't be

//         guest could clear localStorage and reload to vote again, so
//         "have they already voted" has to be answered from something the
//         client can't fake: the actual TCP-layer request IP. That can
//         only be read server-side.

//         CSV server-side via the Admin SDK, rather than round-tripping

// ── /api/admin/withdrawals/:id/payout ── Real NGN bank payout ─────────────
// Fills the gap flagged in the MARKETPLACE ESCROW PAYOUT RULE comment near
// the top of this file: sellers accumulate real money in
// users/{sellerId}.fiatBalance.NGN from naira marketplace sales, but until
// now there was no route that could actually send it to their bank account.
//
// Scope, deliberately narrow: this route ONLY pays out
// withdrawal_requests/{id} docs where currency === 'NGN' AND method ===
// 'bank'. Those are always naira-earnings withdrawals — see
// app-marketplace-sellers.js's "Withdraw to Bank" flow, the only place that
// currency/method combination is ever written. Every other withdrawal
// (EMPY via empyrean-card/usdt/bank, i.e. the general wallet withdrawal
// form in app-patch-v48.js) is untouched by this route and keeps working
// exactly as before — approve there just flips Firestore status, no real
// transfer, because there's no real fiat behind an EMPY balance to move.
//
// Reuses bulk-disburse-routes.js's exported getBankList/resolveBankCode/
// resolveAccount/transfer instead of a second Flutterwave integration — see
// that file's own header comment for why Transfers (not Checkout) is the
// right API here, and why a 200 here means "accepted", not "settled".
//
// Auth: same bearer-ID-token + ADMIN_EMAILS gate bulk-disburse-routes.js's
// own _requireAdmin uses (that helper isn't exported — money-moving routes
// each keep their own explicit admin check rather than trusting a shared
// one silently). Duplicated ADMIN_EMAILS on purpose, same reasoning as
// every other file in this codebase that needs a client- or server-side

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// AD REVENUE SHARE — Content Creator Monetization Model (server-side)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FIX (2026-08, follow-up to app-monetization.js §14): the first pass of
// this feature computed everything client-side against a made-up
// perViewUsd constant, had no bridge to a real, withdrawable balance, and
// relied only on Firestore's "admin can write" rule to keep the ledger
// honest. All three are fixed here:
//   1. perViewUsd was fictional — nothing backed the dollar figure a
//      creator saw. Now an admin enters the REAL ad revenue figure for a
//      period (whatever an actual ad network/partner pays this platform)
//      via /set-pool, and every creator's share is a proportional cut of
//      THAT real number, weighted by their share of total platform
//      engagement that period.
//   2. There was no path from the ledger to real money. /request-payout
//      moves a creator's available (unpaid) balance into the existing
//      withdrawal_queue collection — the same collection and the same
//      admin review flow app-monetization.js's EMPY withdrawal form
//      already uses.
//   3. Computation ran in the browser; only a Firestore rule stood
//      between a client and a fabricated ledger entry. Every number here
//      is now computed from `posts`/`users` server-side via the Admin
//      SDK, and firebase-rules.js denies ALL client writes to
//      ad_revenue_shares/ad_revenue_quarterly_reports/
//      ad_revenue_program_meta outright (`if false`) — the client can
//      only read what this file already wrote. Per-period idempotency
//      (lastPeriodKey) stops a second run of the same period from
//      double-crediting, and a trailing-average anomaly check withholds
//      credit (flags for review instead) on an obvious view-stuffing
//      spike rather than paying it out automatically.

// ── /api/admin/media-migration ── Cloudinary -> Firebase Storage ──────────
// One-off (repeatable/idempotent) background job for the 2026-08 Cloudinary
// stall: old posts/reels/statuses/etc still hold `https://res.cloudinary.com/
// dxwmts9vw/...` URLs from before the Blaze-plan switch to Firebase Storage
// (see app-dom.js's uploadToCloudinary — new uploads already go to Storage;
// this route is ONLY for the historical URLs already sitting in Firestore).
//
// Deliberately NOT a fixed per-collection field list (posts.mediaUrl,
// reels.videoUrl, etc.) — this codebase has ~30+ collections and several
// (chats/{id}/msgs, comments/replies) are nested subcollections reachable
// only via collectionGroup(). Instead this deep-scans every field of every
// doc in the configured targets for any string containing a Cloudinary URL,
// wherever it's nested (works for arrays of attachments, {url, thumb} maps,
// etc. with zero schema knowledge). Firestore Timestamp/GeoPoint values are
// left untouched (they have no cloudinary content and recursing into their
// internals would break them).
//
// Flow: POST /start kicks off an in-memory job (same pattern as bulk-
// disburse-routes.js's _batches Map) and returns immediately; the job then
// (1) scans all targets and collects every distinct Cloudinary URL found,
// (2) downloads + re-uploads each DISTINCT url exactly once (so a thumbnail
// reused across 40 posts is only migrated once), (3) re-walks each affected
// doc and writes back only the top-level fields that actually changed.
// GET /:id/status polls progress. A urlsFailed entry (bad/expired Cloudinary
// URL — the account being on a stalled plan may mean SOME assets are truly
// gone) leaves that one field's URL untouched rather than blanking it, so a
// failed migration never destroys a working reference by accident.
//
// Uploaded files get a `firebaseStorageDownloadTokens` metadata value and a
// hand-built https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/... URL — the exact
// format admin.storage()'s Node SDK doesn't return directly but Firebase's
// own client getDownloadURL() calls produce — so every migrated URL plays
// back through the existing <video>/<img> tags with zero frontend changes.

// routes.js's own header comment explicitly flag: a successful response
// from Flutterwave's Transfers API means the transfer was ACCEPTED for
// processing, not that it has SETTLED. Until now nothing in this codebase
// ever found out whether an accepted transfer actually landed — this route
// is that missing piece. Flutterwave calls it asynchronously once a
// transfer's real outcome is known.
//
// Reference format tells us which system a payout came from (both already
// build references this exact way, nothing changed there):
//   'WD-<withdrawalRequestId>'     — this file's /payout route, above

// must match a secret string YOU set once in the Flutterwave dashboard
// (Settings > Webhooks) — this is NOT FLW_SECRET_KEY and needs its own new
// Render env var, FLW_WEBHOOK_HASH (see render.yaml). Anything without a
// matching header is ignored — that's the only thing standing between this
// public URL and anyone on the internet POSTing a fake "your transfer
// failed" event.

// REDESIGN (2026-07-29 — replaces the old "one oversized avatar stretched
// to the middle of the card" look, per the reference screenshot): the
// avatar is meant to be a small circle-cropped badge tucked into the
// TOP-LEFT corner with a white ring, matching how a real WhatsApp/
// Facebook share card frames the sender's photo — not a giant centered
// portrait. The white logo badge (_logoOverlayLayer) is stamped
// bottom-right on the same canvas, so the card reads "branded post from
// this person" at a glance instead of just "here's someone's face".
//
// FIX (2026-08-18 — reported again: "the profile avatar picture is at the
// center and very blur"): the previous canvas ('w_1,h_1,c_fill' collapsing
// the avatar down to a single pixel, then 'c_pad' framing THAT into
// 1200x630) was meant to make the collapsed pixel invisible, but
// Cloudinary's c_pad scales a square source up to fill the SHORTER target
// dimension (630 here) before padding the rest with the background color
// — so instead of vanishing, that 1x1 pixel was stretched into a visible
// ~630x630 smear of the avatar's own average color sitting dead center of
// the card, underneath the small corner badge. That smear is exactly the
// "center and very blur" symptom. Deriving the canvas from the avatar
// photo at all was the mistake — this now builds the base canvas from the
// site's own already-correct 1200x630 branded card asset
// (_fallbackCardUrl, the same one used as the ultimate no-post-found
// fallback further down this file) instead, so nothing of the avatar is
// ever baked into the background — the avatar only ever appears as the
// small top-left corner badge it was always meant to be.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have.</p>' +
        '<p>By creating an account or using Empyrean, you agree to the collection and use of information as described here.</p>' +
        '<h4>1. Information We Collect</h4><p><strong>Provided by you:</strong></p><ul>' +
        '<li><strong>Account information:</strong> full name, username, email address, phone number, and profile photo. Passwords are handled by Firebase Authentication — we never see or store raw passwords.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Identity verification (KYC):</strong> if you use wallet, payout, or grant-disbursement features, a government-issued ID and related verification information, to comply with financial and anti-fraud regulations.</li>' +

        '<li><strong>Payment information:</strong> wallet funding, EMPY token purchases, and payments are processed by our licensed payment processor, Flutterwave. Empyrean does not collect or store your full card or bank account number. In-app EMPY token purchases on the Android app will use Google Play Billing, in line with Google Play policy for digital goods.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>SOS/emergency requests:</strong> details you submit, and, if you choose to share it, your location. Contact details on SOS reports are never shown publicly — visible only to authorized admin reviewers.</li>' +

// ── FREE-TIER KEEP-ALIVE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// FIX (root cause of "push notifications work once, then stop for good" on
// Render's Free plan): Free-tier services spin down after ~15 minutes with
// no INCOMING HTTP request. A new Firestore doc being created does NOT
// count as traffic to this server — Firestore talks to Google's servers,
// not to this dyno — so the exact moment a user creates a post is exactly
// the moment this process is most likely to be asleep, with the
// _watchCollection/_watchStatuses listeners above not running at all (a
// sleeping dyno doesn't run JS, so reconnect logic can't save it either —
// this needs a different fix than the listener-reconnect one above).
//
// The standard, no-cost workaround: have the server hit its OWN public URL
// on an interval shorter than the spin-down window, so Render always sees
// recent inbound traffic and never considers this dyno idle in the first
// place. This does NOT wake an already-sleeping dyno (a sleeping process
// runs no code, so it can't fire its own timer) — it only works by making
// sure the dyno never falls asleep to begin with, which is sufficient as
// long as the interval below stays comfortably under 15 minutes and this
// process itself never crashes/redeploys and sits dead for a stretch first.
// If it DOES go to sleep before this ships (or after a deploy), the very
// next real visitor's page load is what wakes it back up, same as today.
//
// Pings /api/config specifically — it's the same lightweight route
// render.yaml already uses as healthCheckPath, does no Firestore read, and
// req.protocol/host don't matter here since RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL already IS
// this service's full public https URL.
//
// Deliberately does nothing outside Render (no RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL means
// local dev, or a host that doesn't need this trick) — so this is a no-op
// everywhere except where it's actually needed.
