   EMPYREAN INTERNATIONAL — app-patch-openchat.js
   Load AFTER app-patch-v2.js

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES
   ────────────────────
   Defines  window.openChat(userId)  — the one function that was called
   everywhere (contact-item clicks, profile message button, marketplace)
   but never implemented.

   FEATURES
   ────────
   [1] Looks up the user from window.mockUsers → Firestore fallback
   [2] Populates #chat-header-info with avatar, name, online dot
   [3] Shows   #chat-view-container, hides #chat-placeholder
   [4] Adds a sticky WhatsApp-style header: back ← | avatar | name | video 📹 | call 📞 | ⋮
   [5] Subscribes to Firestore messages for this thread in real-time
   [6] Renders bubbles into #chat-messages-container (independent scroll)
   [7] Wires #message-form / #vf-msg-send → saves to Firestore messages collection
   [8] Keeps input + send button fixed at bottom via existing flex CSS
   [9] Mobile full-screen (position:absolute, covers status bar)
   [10] Long-press on any bubble → WhatsApp emoji reaction bar
        (👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 🙏 ❌ +) with live Firestore update

       guards itself against being executed twice — because this dev
       environment's hot-reload/live-preview tooling can re-inject a
       script into an already-loaded page without a real navigation.
       v39's own header documents that exact scenario previously
       leaving a duplicate, orphaned Agora client publishing at once on
       the live-streaming side, producing overlapping audio and
       "frozen" taps. This file — the one that owns 1:1 voice/video
       calls (RTCPeerConnection, getUserMedia, the whole Firestore
       calls/{callId} signalling flow) — never had the same guard, so a
       duplicate execution here would create a second, independent
       _peerId/_rtc closure with its own RTCPeerConnection, competing

       a STALE cached id restored from localStorage (_tryImmediateSessionRestore
       in app-fixes.js) that never gets reconciled with the live Firebase
       Auth session when that session is anonymous or absent — the existing
       upgrade-in-memory fix only runs for `!fbUser.isAnonymous`. Firestore's
       rules for /calls and /messages require request.auth.uid to EXACTLY
       equal the callerId/senderId field we write, so any drift between the
       cached app-level id and the live Firebase UID causes an instant,
       silent permission-denied on call/message writes. Reading the live

       that anonymous sign-in completes, onAuthStateChanged fires and this
       function was overwriting the real userState.id with the throwaway
       anonymous UID, permanently mismatching every existing doc's

       reported it and then blocked the call — it never actually repaired
       userState.id, so calling stayed permanently dead until the user
       manually logged out and back in. app-fixes.js already has this
       exact self-heal (Object.assign + userState.id = fbUser.uid) for the
       "upgrade in memory" path, but that path only fires from inside
       onAuthStateChanged for a NON-anonymous fbUser, so it can miss cases
       where the live session is already non-anonymous but userState was
       populated earlier from a stale localStorage snapshot (e.g. a prior
       account on the same device/session). Self-heal right here instead,

       note player (audio branch of _buildBubble, below), fixed once here
       rather than patched three times at each call site.

       [1] Duration permanently stuck at "0:00".
           ROOT CAUSE: every duration read in the player did a single,
           direct `vnAudio.duration` check on 'loadedmetadata'. Chrome (and
           Chromium-based WebViews) commonly report `duration` as Infinity
           or NaN for a MediaRecorder-produced webm/opus blob — the exact
           format this app's own recorder produces (see _startRecording) —
           until the element is actually seeked near its end once. That's
           a well-documented browser quirk with recorded (as opposed to
           server-muxed) media, not something a single 'loadedmetadata'
           listener can ever resolve on its own, which is why the number
           never recovered no matter how long the bubble sat on screen.
           _resolveVoiceNoteDuration applies the standard fix (seek to a
           huge currentTime, then back to 0, which forces the browser to
           compute the real duration) automatically whenever the plain
           read comes back non-finite, and also watches 'durationchange'
           (fires in browsers that never satisfy 'loadedmetadata' with a
           usable number) so this recovers on any engine, not just one. */

               open chat panel was actually painting at the absolute max
               z-index — higher than #oc-call-modal (999999), the bubble
               long-press emoji sheet/overlay (9999998/9999999), and the
               lightbox/media panel (9999998/9999999). Those elements were
               still being created correctly when their buttons were tapped,
               but they rendered UNDERNEATH the opaque chat panel, so nothing
               appeared to happen. The instant X was tapped, .oc-mobile-open
               was removed, the chat panel's inflated z-index went away, and
               whatever had silently opened became visible — now floating
               over the contact list instead of the chat.
               FIX: drop the z-index override here entirely. The earlier
               z-index:99999!important rule (already more than enough to
               cover the rest of the app/nav bar, which was this block's
               original purpose) now applies uncontested, restoring the
               correct stacking order: chat panel < call modal < emoji /
               lightbox overlays. */

       FIX (bug: "voice/video calls and emojis respond outside the chat box,
       after exit") — second half of the fix.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Even with the z-index conflict above corrected, there's still a path
       to the same symptom: if the user taps X WHILE the bubble emoji
       catalog (or the composer's full emoji panel, or the quick-react bar,
       or the 3-dot menu) happens to be open, none of those elements were
       ever torn down by _doCloseChat() — they live independently of
       #chat-view-container. Closing the chat would leave them floating on
       top of the now-visible contact list. This single helper removes all
       of them; it's called from _doCloseChat() below, every time the chat
       closes, so nothing from the chat box can ever survive past exit.
       NOTE: #oc-call-modal is deliberately NOT included here — an in-progress
       call is meant to keep running after the chat panel closes (same as a
       phone call surviving you backgrounding the app), and it already has
       its own correct teardown in _rtcHangup().

                   (avatar on the right) based on a different, ambiguous
                   reference case (a forwarded/no-avatar group message).

                   pieces below rather than moving their construction code,

           updated or rendered — _handleSnap below now flips it to true the
           moment an incoming message is seen while the chat is open, and
           _buildBubble/_applyTickState render blue double-ticks for it.
         • "Delivered and recipient online" is read straight from the
           already-existing presence/{userId} heartbeat doc (written every
           ~20s by app-patch-v11.js per firebase-rules.js) for the ONE peer
           this chat is open with — a single lightweight doc subscription,

    /* FIX (tick-mark bug: double-check shown immediately instead of after
       a real delivery): app-fix-final.js's presence heartbeat (§11,
       fixOnlineStatus/_heartbeat) writes presence/{uid}.online:true every
       60s while a user's app is open/active, but NOTHING anywhere ever
       writes it back to false — there's no visibility/pagehide/unload
       handler and Firestore (unlike the Realtime Database) has no
       server-side onDisconnect(). So once any user has opened the app a
       single time, their presence doc says online:true PERMANENTLY, and
       every peer looks "online" forever — which is why every message here
       jumped straight to a double tick instead of starting at one.

       FIX: don't trust the online:true flag by itself. Also require
       lastSeen (written on every heartbeat) to be recent — within
       PRESENCE_FRESH_MS, comfortably more than one heartbeat interval
       (60s) so a normal gap between beats never flickers it offline, but
       short enough that a peer who closed the app / lost network without
       ever getting a chance to write online:false stops being treated as
       "online" shortly after their last real heartbeat. This is the
       correct fix regardless of whether app-fix-final.js is later updated
       to also write online:false on visibilitychange/pagehide (best-effort

    /* FIX (bug: "video call bounces back after deploying to Render, worked
       fine before"): STUN-only ICE (below) lets two peers discover their
       public IP:port, but it does nothing when either side sits behind a
       symmetric or carrier-grade NAT — which is exactly what mobile data
       networks (4G/LTE) commonly use. On the same Wi-Fi/local network,
       direct P2P negotiates fine even with STUN alone, which is why this
       looked like it "worked" before deployment. Once real users on real
       (often cellular) networks call each other, ICE negotiation fails,
       RTCPeerConnection.connectionState goes to 'failed', and
       onconnectionstatechange (see _createPC above) calls _rtcHangup() —
       which is the "bounce back". This is NOT a Firebase rules issue; the
       call doc, offer/answer, and ICE candidate writes all succeed (that
       part of the signaling works) — it's the *media path itself* that
       can't establish. The fix is a TURN server, which relays media when
       direct P2P isn't possible.

       UPDATE — the TURN entry below used to point at
       turn:openrelay.metered.ca with the credential 'openrelayproject':
       Metered's own PUBLIC, unauthenticated example credential, published
       in their docs and copy-pasted by countless unrelated projects
       worldwide with no per-account quota of their own. That's the
       traceable cause of the intermittent total call failures and the
       one-direction-dies-after-a-few-minutes symptom this app was hitting
       — not a code bug, a shared/rate-limited relay under load from every
       other app using that same public demo credential. Replaced with a
       private Metered.ca account allocation (own username/credential,
       own quota, not shared with anyone else) as of this session. Revisit
       if usage grows past the free tier — Twilio Network Traversal
       Service, Xirsys, Cloudflare Calls, or a self-hosted coturn remain
       the production-scale options at that point. */

       promise chain (getUserMedia → create/answer offer → write the call
       doc to Firestore) rejects for ANY reason — which is exactly what
       "opens then closes right away" looks like from the outside. The
       previous catch collapsed every possible cause into one of two vague
       strings, which made it impossible to tell which of several very
       different problems was actually happening. This logs the real
       error (name/code/message) to console and picks the specific,
       actionable message for the most likely causes:
         • NotAllowedError / SecurityError → mic/camera permission was
           never granted. On a plain website this is a browser permission
           prompt; if this build is wrapped in a native Android WebView
           app, getUserMedia() ALSO requires the native app's
           WebChromeClient.onPermissionRequest() to grant camera/mic to
           the WebView — a step that's easy to miss when wrapping a site,
           and something no amount of JS here can fix on its own.
         • NotFoundError → no camera/microphone on this device.
         • Firestore 'permission-denied' → the calls/{callId} write (or
           its callerCandidates/calleeCandidates subcollection) was
           rejected by firestore.rules. This app's history has repeatedly
           hit this exact class of bug for other collections (active_
           streams, notifications, savedContacts, business_posts comments)
           — the 'calls' collection is newer and may not have a matching
           rule yet. If this is the cause, the fix is a firestore.rules
           change (share the file and I'll add the right match block),

    /* ── AUTOPLAY-BLOCKED AUDIO FIX ────────────────────────────────────
       BUG: "call connects, other person hears/sees me, I can't hear
       them" — one-directional, intermittent (worse on a fresh browser
       session/device). NOT a TURN/network issue — media is arriving
       fine; it just never plays.
       ROOT CAUSE: rv.play() / speakerEl.play() below used to be called
       on an UNMUTED element carrying live audio, with any rejection
       swallowed by an empty .catch(). Chrome/Android (and most modern
       browsers) block autoplay of unmuted audio unless the browser
       already has a "media engagement" allowance for this origin from
       an earlier session, or play() happens inside a synchronous user
       gesture. pc.ontrack (which is what calls _attachRemoteStream)
       fires asynchronously, well after the original Call/Accept tap's
       gesture window has closed — so on a fresh session this rejection
       happens routinely. The <video> still renders normally either way
       (decoding/painting frames isn't gated the same way autoplay-with-
       -sound is), so the call visibly "connects" while audio silently
       never starts — nothing previously surfaced this failure.
       FIX: try unmuted playback first (succeeds whenever the browser
       already allows it, which is most of the time after first use).
       If that's rejected, fall back to muted playback (always
       succeeds) and show a small "tap to hear audio" banner. Setting
       el.muted = false inside THAT banner's own click handler is a
       genuine user gesture acting on already-playing media, which is
       permitted regardless of any prior engagement history. */

       AUDIO QUALITY (1:1 calls) — three separate levers:
       1) CAPTURE: plain `audio:true` gives the browser's default mic
          constraints, which on many devices means no echo cancellation /
          noise suppression and a low sample rate. _micConstraints() below
          asks for the good versions of all three explicitly — this is
          what actually determines how clean the audio the OTHER person
          hears is, since it shapes what leaves this device in the first
          place.
       2) ENCODE: WebRTC's default Opus bitrate for a voice call is quite
          low (~32kbps mono) to be bandwidth-conservative. _boostAudioBitrate
          raises the outgoing audio RTCRtpSender's target bitrate after
          tracks are added, for noticeably crisper voice on a decent
          connection, while Opus's built-in bandwidth adaptation still
          protects calls on a poor connection.
       3) PLAYBACK: remote audio used to just play at the <video>/<audio>
          element's own volume (capped at 1.0, and quiet on some devices'
          output routing). _boostRemoteAudioGain routes it through a Web
          Audio GainNode instead, so it can be boosted past 1.0 — the
          media element's own audio path is muted so it isn't heard twice.

           RTCRtpSender.setParameters, but that API isn't implemented on
           every browser; this SDP-level version is the more universally
           supported of the two, so both are kept as belt-and-suspenders.
         - dtx=0 : stops the encoder from cutting to near-silence during
           quiet/pause moments to save bandwidth — a legitimate feature in
           general, but on a call this app's users already describe as
           having quality problems, the on/off warble it produces reads
           as "choppy audio," not as a helpful optimization.

       MID-CALL ICE-RESTART RECOVERY
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       BUG/GAP: pc.onconnectionstatechange's 'disconnected' case only ever
       updated the on-screen text to "Reconnecting…" — it never actually
       tried to recover the media path. On a genuinely weak/bouncing mobile
       connection (exactly what this app's own users are testing on —
       1-2 signal bars, single-digit KB/s), WebRTC's OWN built-in ICE
       connectivity checks can and do recover on their own sometimes, but
       there's no guarantee, and nothing here was actively helping — which
       matches "it started working again later" being pure luck rather
       than something the app did.
       FIX: only the CALLER attempts a restart (avoids both sides racing
       to renegotiate at once — this app's signalling already has a fixed
       offerer/answerer split, so keeping restarts one-directional avoids
       glare without needing a full perfect-negotiation pattern). After a
       short grace period stuck in 'disconnected' (recovers on its own
       within that window on plenty of blips — no need to touch anything),
       the caller creates a fresh ICE-restart offer and writes it to the
       SAME calls/{callId} doc under a bumped offerVersion. The callee's
       own call-doc listener (see _answerCall) watches for that version
       bump and answers it automatically, without the callee ever tapping
       anything. Capped at 3 attempts per call so a truly dead network
       doesn't retry forever — past that, the browser's own connectionState
       will eventually reach 'failed', which the existing case below still
       hangs up on. */

               return icon on some Android keyboards/builds — and on those,
               tapping that icon doesn't reliably fire a keydown this
               listener can see/preventDefault, so the keydown guard below
               (which is otherwise correct) never gets a chance to run.
               Explicitly requesting the "enter" hint forces the return-

       spec item to bring the group-chat recorder's behavior here):
       the old version had two gaps the group chat implementation
       (app-patch-v13.js _startRecording) already closed:
         1. It never checked for `window.MediaRecorder` before calling
            `new MediaRecorder(stream)`. Browsers/WebViews without
            MediaRecorder (or where it's only exposed under a vendor
            prefix / not at all, e.g. some in-app browsers and older
            Android WebViews) throw a ReferenceError-style exception
            there, INSIDE a promise .then() — with no .catch() below it
            able to see a synchronous throw from that statement wrapped
            safely, this surfaced as an unhandled rejection and the mic
            button just silently stopped doing anything.
         2. `new MediaRecorder(stream)` with no mimeType let the browser
            pick a default; on browsers where the default codec path is
            unreliable this can throw at construction time too, again
            with nothing catching it.
       This version adds the same feature-detection, explicit
       audio/webm negotiation, and try/catch around construction that
       app-patch-v13.js's group voice notes already use, plus the same
       minimum-recording-length guard, so behavior is now identical

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Belt-and-suspenders against the exact symptom reported: the X looks
       right and sits at max z-index, but tapping it does nothing. That
       happens when some OTHER element — invisible, transparent, or simply
       unknown to us — is physically on top of it in the paint order and
       swallows the tap before it ever reaches #oc-back-btn. Rather than
       trying to guess every possible culprit element, we hit-test by
       SCREEN COORDINATES: any tap/click landing inside the close button's
       visible box closes the chat, regardless of which element actually
       received the event. Shares _closeDebounce with the button's own
       listeners (§7) so a tap that DOES reach the real button correctly
       can never double-fire this fallback.
       ========================================================================= */

           bug was fixed and the chat header started laying out at its correct,
           stable position, the video-call, voice-call, emoji, and voice-note
           buttons in that same header could end up sitting inside (or very
           near) #oc-back-btn's last-measured bounding box during a reflow.
           Any click landing in that box — including clicks squarely on those
           OTHER buttons — was treated as a tap on the X, and _doCloseChat()
           immediately calls ev.stopPropagation()/preventDefault(), which
           killed the click before it ever reached the real button's own
           listener. That's why those four controls silently stopped working.
           FIX: require the click's TARGET to actually be #oc-back-btn (or a
           descendant of it, e.g. its inner <svg>/<path>) in addition to the
           coordinate check. This still catches the original "invisible
           overlay sitting on top of the real button" case the coordinate
           check was built for, since closest() walks up from whatever
